I have usded two API calls for this project.
One is =https://openweathermap.org and other one is https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities/
To load the weather api deatails user should have an account in this api =>https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities/(which is in second api) and subscribed for it. But it is completely free.
